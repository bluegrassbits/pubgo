# Documentation

Welcome to the PubGo documentation. This section provides comprehensive
information on how to install, configure, and use PubGo for your content
publishing needs.

## Getting Started

### Basics

How to install PubGo on your local machine or server.

Assuming you have `git` and `go` installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bluegrassbits/pubgo.git
cd pubgo
go build
./pubgo
```

You can also copy this binary someplace thats in your `$PATH` on your system.

`config.yaml` is the default configuration filename. There is a `config.yaml`
at the root of the `pubgo` repository. This will serve up this website locally.

If you'd like to start from scratch:

```bash
mkdir new_project
cp pubgo new_project/
# or
go build -o new_project/
cd new_project
./pubgo
```

This will bootstrap the current directory with a boilerplate config file,
static content directory, and a `home.md`.

### Docker

You can use the following to build a docker container to host your content.

```bash
mkdir new_project

docker build -t pubgo \
    --build-arg UID=$UID \
    --build-arg GID=$UID .

docker run -it -p 8080:8080  -v ./new_project:/opt/pubgo pubgo
```

### Static site compiling

To generate a static site, use the `build` mode:

```bash
./pubgo -mode build -content_dir ./website -out ./out
```

## Configuration:

Understanding the configuration file structure and how to customize PubGo for your
specific requirements.

Commandline flags:

```bash
$ ./pubgo -h
Usage of ./pubgo:
  -config string
        Path to config file (default "config.yaml")
  -content_dir string
        Content directory (default "./website")
  -mode string
        Run mode: <serve> or <build> static site (default "serve")
  -out string
        Output directory for static site (default "./out")
```

The from scratch instructions above should result in a config file that looks
something like this:

### Config example

```yaml
# config.yaml
content_dir: ./website
base_url: ""
port: 8080
site:
    name: My Site
    logo: ""
    logo_width: ""
    logo_height: 32px
    pages:
        "0":
            name: home
            path: /
            hide_from_nav: true
            collection: false
            hero:
                background: "#dcdcdc"
                content: Welcome to my site
                sub_content: This is a simple site
                image: https://picsum.photos/200
                background_image: https://picsum.photos/400
        "1":
            name: blog
            path: /blog
            hide_from_nav: false
            collection: true
            hero:
                background: ""
                content: ""
                sub_content: ""
                image: ""
                background_image: ""
    theme:
        background_color: "#eeeeee"
        text_color: "#020202"
        main_color: "#020202"
        accent_color: "#020202"
        font_family: monospace
    title: ""
    footer_content: Powered by PubGo (https://pubgo.org) - CopyRight Â© 2019 My Site
    favicon: ""
    stylesheet: ""
```

**NOTE:** Any static files used in the configuration should be placed in
`<content_dir>/static`. If this directory doesn't exist, pubgo will attempt to
create it on startup.

### Main config breakdown

| Option                      | type       | Description                                                                                                    | Default |

| **site**>**name**           | string     | site name, used for header and title                                                                           | PubGo   |
| **site**>**logo**           | string     | path to logo image. used for header if present. path is relative to `config_dir`. should start with `/static/` |         |
| **site**>**logo_width**     | string     | width of _logo_ image in header                                                                                | "32px"  |

### Site config breakdown

In addition to the options listed above, there are a couple of nested options.
These are the **site**>**theme** and the **site**>**pages**.

For **site**>**theme**, please reference the example config above. Most of it
should be self-explanatory. This page provides a way to do some basic
customization.

### Site > Pages config breakdown

This is were the pages of your site can be setup. **sites**>**pages** is
a _key/value_ data structure. The _key_ here should be a numeric value. This
value is used for sorting, specifically the sort order of pages that are
included in the header navigation.

The _value_ portion of this is the configuration for a single page.

### Page config

```yaml
pages:
    name: home
    path: /
    hide_from_nav: true
    collection: false
    hero:
        background: ""
        content: ""
        sub_content: ""
        image: ""
        background_image: ""
```

#### Page config details

An important piece of page configuration is the **collection** bit. If _true_,
then the page is expected to display multiple entries of content.

-   Collections pages will look for content in **\<content_dir\>/\<page_name\>/**
-   Non-Collections pages expect **\<content_dir\>/\<page_name\>.md**

<br/>

#### Other page options

| Option            | Type   | Description                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **name**          | string | the page name. for not "/" routes this is used for the page \<title\> |
| **path**          | string | this is used in route handling configuration. for collections         |
| **hide_from_nav** | bool   | whether or not to hide page from navbar                               |
| **collection**    | bool   | whether or not this page contains multiple entries                    |
| **hero**          | object | page hero configuration, see example above for options                |
